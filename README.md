# Soundzie
This is the official repository of Soundzie by Team Soundzonix.
We created this as our 1st semester project in college and it helped us a lot in finding out a lot about python and tkinter.
Soundzie is a Desktop Application that has a music player, a video player and a couple of games made using pygame.
We hope you like it as much as we do. Any suggestions are welcome.
:)
